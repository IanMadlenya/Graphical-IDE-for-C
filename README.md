TITLE OF PROJECT: Code In-C-eption 

CATEGORY PREFERENCE: Software Design (Application Development) 

OBJECTIVE: Developing a web app which would help in teaching students the language C using a graphical interface. C code will be generated automatically from drag-able C code blocks. 

IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY: The application will be developed such that the basic building blocks of the language C will be provided to the user in the form of jigsaw shaped drag-able blocks. A corresponding C source file will be generated which will be compiled and executed using a shell script. The child jig-saw blocks will fit only in corresponding parent block – hence helping the user to write syntactically correct code. The expected tool set includes Linux Shell scripting, Javascript, PHP & C.

APPLICATION: The web application shall help new programmers to intuitively understand programming and remove initial apprehension towards code. This can surely prove as an efficient learning tool for learning C.  Similar to an IDE, it will help users avoid common mistakes and follow standard programming conventions. 

JUSTIFY CHOICE OF CATEGORY: This software application will help everyone from novice programmers to software developers. With a wide audience base, this software surely is falls under Application Development. 
BASIC EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECT: The project will consist of the various commands/syntax used in C in the form of jigsaw puzzle pieces. 
\

GUI Mock Up of the Drag-able C blocks : Two pieces will fit in together only when they form the correct syntax. The application will also provide the user with all the information about each command/syntax. All the user has to do is to drag the various pieces.

TENTATIVE TIMELINE: This project requires coding on two levels - Firstly we need to make the drag- able blocks and secondly we need to generate the corresponding C source file. This will take little more than 2 months of hard work from the whole team. Making syntactically compatible blocks will itself take around a month followed by a similar amount of time for developing the rest. 

FEASIBILITY: Most linux servers allow shell scripting. This can be used to compile and execute C code generated using Front-end Web Technologies e.g. JS. In case, a need to change the tools for drag-able C code blocks is felt, there is sufficient time to gather required technical know-how. Hence, we are assured that it’s feasible in the time-span. 

AVENUES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: 
- Many more advanced commands of C can be incorporated.
- Saving projects, converting an already existing C source file into the format of our software is an essential option to be added to this software. 
- Improved suggestion and tutorials to teach C programming. - Incorporate more programming languages.  
- Build a line-by-line code execution viewer analogous to PythonTutor.com

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT: The project targets beginner to novice programmers. It is limited by internet connectivity since we intend to develop and deliver it as a web app. Being a web app, removes constraints of OS and other hardware, is easy to use since there is no installation or similar hassles at the user end. All execution is taken care of at developer end.
